Subject: Request for Extension of Due Date for Task

Dear sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a family emergency that has arisen at my place, and unfortunately, I will not be able to meet the original due date of the task assigned to me.

Due to the unexpected situation, I am unable to allocate the required time and focus on completing the task. I understand the importance of meeting the deadline, and I deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause.

I am humbly requesting for an extension of three days to complete the task. I assure you that I will make every effort to complete the task to the best of my abilities and within the extended time frame.

Thank you for your understanding  during this difficult time. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Binod nayak
